			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocode & Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To think in terms of pseudocoding before going straight into coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled with starting on the pseudocoding for the "simple computer game" task. I couldn't get my mind into the 'pseudocoding mindset', but my partner helped me out a ton on this aspect. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think that I did the best I could. The lab wasn't too hard to accomplish, and although I did struggle to think up of the correct way to type up the pseudocode for the computer game task, I'm glad my partner helped me out. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to think of a skill that would be worth talking about step-by-step, but I'm quite satisfied with my simple craft idea. There were enough steps to type out a decently long instruction! </p>

						// how to create a handmade plastic keychain
						// gather materials
						  // thin COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT sheet of polystrene plastic that can be found from takout food 
						  // if polystrene is unavailable, purchase Shrinky Dink specifically
						  // colored pencils, alcohol or paint markers
						  // hole puncher
						  // scissors
						  // file or sandpaper with soft grit
						  // a heat gun or oven
						  // jumpring and string
						  // pliers
						  // paper
						  // printer, optional
						  // oven safe pan
						  // parchment paper
						  // a book or something heavy with a flat surface
						// create a reference
						  // on the piece of paper, draw something that you want to create into a keychain; printing something on the paper is optional as well
						  // make sure to have the reference be three times the size you want the keychain to be
						  // a few centimeters from the top, draw a circle for where the jumprings and keychain will go
						  // cut around the reference, leaving a few centimeters of space from the edge for a clean look
						// copy reference onto plastic sheet
						  // if using paint markers or colored pencils, use a file or sandpaper to softly roughen the surface of the plastic sheet on the area effected
						  // trace the reference onto the plastic sheet as best as possible
						  // use a hole puncher at the top where it was previously instructed to leave room
						// time to cook it!
						  // on a oven safe pan with parchment paper, place the plastic soon-to-be keychain and bake it at 325 degrees Farenheit or 163 degrees Celsius
						  // after it's done warping and has shrunk relatively to 1/3 it's size, take it out
						  // to ensure flatness, take a book or something heavy with a flat surface, and press it down till it cools
						// time to make it into a keychain!
						  // take jumprings and put it through the hole with pliers
						  // tie a string at the end of the last jumpring
						// now you have your own personalized keychain!!

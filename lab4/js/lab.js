// how to create a handmade plastic keychain
  // gather materials
    // thin COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT sheet of polystrene plastic that can be found from takout food 
    // if polystrene is unavailable, purchase Shrinky Dink specifically
    // colored pencils, alcohol or paint markers
    // hole puncher
    // scissors
    // file or sandpaper with soft grit
    // a heat gun or oven
    // jumpring and string
    // pliers
    // paper
    // printer, optional
    // oven safe pan
    // parchment paper
    // a book or something heavy with a flat surface
  // create a reference
    // on the piece of paper, draw something that you want to create into a keychain; printing something on the paper is optional as well
    // make sure to have the reference be three times the size you want the keychain to be
    // a few centimeters from the top, draw a circle for where the jumprings and keychain will go
    // cut around the reference, leaving a few centimeters of space from the edge for a clean look
  // copy reference onto plastic sheet
    // if using paint markers or colored pencils, use a file or sandpaper to softly roughen the surface of the plastic sheet on the area effected
    // trace the reference onto the plastic sheet as best as possible
    // use a hole puncher at the top where it was previously instructed to leave room
  // time to cook it!
    // on a oven safe pan with parchment paper, place the plastic soon-to-be keychain and bake it at 325 degrees Farenheit or 163 degrees Celsius
    // after it's done warping and has shrunk relatively to 1/3 it's size, take it out
    // to ensure flatness, take a book or something heavy with a flat surface, and press it down till it cools
  // time to make it into a keychain!
    // take jumprings and put it through the hole with pliers
    // tie a string at the end of the last jumpring
  // now you have your own personalized keychain!!

    // players can only choose the bottom-most available space in any given column

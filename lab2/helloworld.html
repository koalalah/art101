                <h2>Description of me:</h2>
                <p>My name's Kayla Harimurti, and I'm a third year transfer to UC Santa Cruz. My favorite past times are of course playing games, and reading webcomics. I also enjoy drawing, tradition/digital, and just keeping up with makeup trends.

            <h2> Description of my partner:</h2>
            <p>My partner for Lab 2 is Jessica Chen. 
                She enjoys drinking matcha and playing games in her leisure time. My first impression of her is that she is a sweet and funny person, and that I think we get along pretty well :]

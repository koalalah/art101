			<h1>Lab 3 - Learning File Structures and File Transfers!!</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>The Challenges:</h2>
					<p>To learn how to set up file structures in an organized manner, as well learning how to reference/link files.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results:</h2>
					<p>I am still kind of uncomfortable with learning the different elements of coding. So far, the most difficulty I've had was definitely trying to reference different links into my homepage. The actual act of organizing my file structures wasn't that bad. </p>

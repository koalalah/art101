					<p>The API didn't work for me, and overall, I was just really slow to work on this lab... </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Unlike the previous lab, I ran into a LOT of problems. I didn't really understand the lecture that much during class (I was too tired to fully comoprehend what was going on with the code, I just followed along), and the API I think(?), is not working for me. I asked for help from my partner, and a few classmates. They helped me figure my code out.</p>

					<p>I debugged my lab 8 for this lab as it was the only one that I was not able to complete successfully 100%; I also said that I would resubmit it when I had the chance. My problem was that there was no actual Script Output showing. The error stated something along the lines of something going wrong...and it inolving the word asychronous. I managed to fix it by moving my source script more towards the end of my HTML code, as well as including a "document.writeln()" line towards the end of my JS. I don't know how I missed that part my code.  </p>

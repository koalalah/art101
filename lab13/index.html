					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To experiment with loops with partner.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled with actually understanding the concept of loops for some reason (mostly memorizing the symbols and what they did and having to put them together). I kept running into errors in my outputs as well due to small and/or large mistakes. </p>

			<div id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I...I see myself needing to practice this more. I referenced WesBot a LOT with this lab. I was able to ask it for more clarifications luckily which helped my understanding a lot more. I do think that I would need to reference back to class material if we were required to do loops again though...I need to practice.</p>

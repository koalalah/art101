					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I actually got it to work!! It didn't work initially, but that was all me. There were numerous amounts of typos that were in my JavaScript code for the buttons. I was actually able to spot them as though, which I personally take as a win.</p>

			<div id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I find myself being able to spot my typos a little bit easier, which is a personal win in my book. Personally, I think that this means that I have been practicing enough to be comfortable spotting mistakes, I could not have identified before. </p>

					<p> Look! Look! PRESS THE BUTTONS!!(∩｀-´)⊃━☆ﾟ.*･｡ﾟ </p>
